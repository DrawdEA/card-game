# card-game
A card game that has 3 types of cards: Dragon, Fairy, and Ghost. These three are weak to each other, just like how rock paper scissors work.
These cards have their own health and attack.

Each player has 5 cards in their hand. Each turn, they can choose to attack or swap.

If the player chooses attack, they attack using their card, doubling or halfing depending on the card type and the opponents card type.

If the player chooses swap, the active card swaps with the highest "Determining Power" in their hand.
